            <h2>Below is what I learned throughout the development of this Decision Tree Project</h2>
            <ol class="skills-list">
                <li>1. How to write some code to be able to construct a decision tree.</li>
                
                <li>2. The next step for me was to pick out what pieces I needed from my dataset to make my decision tree. So I 
                picked 4 of the columns in my dataset to use for the constructing of my decision tree.</li>

                <li>3. I learned that, with a decision tree you need a X and y for your decision tree. <br> For example,
                <br>import pandas as pd<br>
                dataset = "PremierLeagueSeason2024.csv"<br>
                read = pd.read_csv(dataset) <br>
                data = ['goals_scored', 'goals_conceded', 'wins'] # this is what I am trying to predict from <br>
                XVAL = read[data] # this is my target colunm I am trying to predict <br>
                y = read['rank']<br></li>

                <li>4. Once I understood my decision tree, I decided to try and visualize my decision tree. Initial this was not to bad
                but once I started to scale up my decision tree it was becoming un-readable and very big, this lead me to a few 
                websites to try and debug the problem but I was unable to find the problem. So I went to chatgpt and I asked him a question
                along the lines of: "how do I visualize my decision tree without it being to blurry and not to big", it did not give me
                the answer straight away, it took a few prompts but eventually he gave me some code that worked but I didn't just 
                take it because it worked, I read the code and I made sure that I understood it before 
                taking it and putting it into my decision tree project.</li>

                <li>5. After I had constructed my decision tree I got my data from my linear regression project and I performed some 
                analysis to see what the decision tree looked like, with the above code that I got from chatgpt.</li>

                <li>6. The next thing I learned was that if you don't provide a max-depth to your decision tree and your data is quite big 
                your decision tree can get very big very quickly and you won't be able to read or understand your decision tree 
                due to it beingun-readable.</li>
                
                <li>7. To fix this issue all you need to do is give your decision tree a max-depth of a certain value then you won't 
                encounter this problem. For example, biggerTree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3).</li>
                            
                <li>8. I learned how to some new technologies such as load_iris and DecisionTreeClassifier.</li>
                <li>9. I learned how to know what data I needed to use for my decision tree and what data I did not need for my decision
                tree.</li>
