            <h2>Below is what I learned throughout the development of this Decision Tree Project</h2>
            <ol class="skills-list">
                <li>1. How to write some code to be able to construct a decision tree.</li>
                
                <li>2. The next step for me was to pick out what pieces I needed from my dataset to make my decision tree. So I 
                picked 4 of the columns in my dataset to use for the constructing of my decision tree.</li>

                <li>3. I learned that with a decision tree you need a X and y for your decision tree. For example,
                ```import pandas as pd
                dataset = "PremierLeagueSeason2024.csv"
                read = pd.read_csv(dataset)
                data = ['goals_scored', 'goals_conceded', 'wins'] this is what I am trying to predict from
                XVAL = read[data] this is my target colunm I am trying to predict
                y = read['rank']```</li>

                <li>2. After I had constructed my decision tree I got my data from my linear regression project and I performed some 
                analysis to see what the decision tree looked like.</li>

                <li>3. Once I understood my decision tree, I decided to try and visualize my decision tree. initial this was not to bad
                but once I started to scale up my decision tree it was becoming un-readable and very big, this lead me to a few 
                websites to try and debug the problem but I was unable to find the problem. So I went to chatgpt and I asked him a question
                along the line of: "how do I visualize my decision tree without it being to blurry and not to big". And then he gave me some
                code that worked but I didn't just take it because it worked, I read the code and I made sure that I understood it before 
                taking it and putting it into my decision tree project.</li>

                <li>4. The next step I did was I </li>
                
                <li>3. In order to see if my data is good for using the linear regression model I fitted a line to my data. </li>
                <li>4. While I was trying to fit a line to my data, I found the code to be a bit confusing but after numerous hours of analysing the code I started to understand what it was doing.</li>
                <li>5. Until this point I had only whole numbers plotted onto a graph with a line fitted to the data. So I decided to get some data online to input into my model. </li>
                <li>6. I got some football data online, this data contained some data that I wanted to use for my model. So I wrote some python code to extract the data that I wanted to put into my model.</li>
                <li>7. After I extracted the data that I wanted I inserted that into my linear regression model and from there I made the data bigger and smaller to see how my python graph could change. </li>
            
                <li>8. I learned how to some new technologies such as Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas.</li>
                <li>9. I learned how to understand data. For example, if I have a very big data set I had to analyse the data set and figure out what data I needed to used
                    for my linear regression model.
