            <h2>Below is what I learned throughout the development of this Decision Tree Project</h2>
            <!--<ol class="skills-list">
                <li>1. How to write a piece of code to plot some points onto a graph using Python.</li>
                <li>2. At the start of this project I was trying to set up my coding working environment and I was running into a few syntax errors but eventually I solved these issues.</li>
                <li>3. In order to see if my data is good for using the linear regression model I fitted a line to my data. </li>
                <li>4. While I was trying to fit a line to my data, I found the code to be a bit confusing but after numerous hours of analysing the code I started to understand what it was doing.</li>
                <li>5. Until this point I had only whole numbers plotted onto a graph with a line fitted to the data. So I decided to get some data online to input into my model. </li>
                <li>6. I got some football data online, this data contained some data that I wanted to use for my model. So I wrote some python code to extract the data that I wanted to put into my model.</li>
                <li>7. After I extracted the data that I wanted I inserted that into my linear regression model and from there I made the data bigger and smaller to see how my python graph could change. </li>
            
                <li>8. I learned how to some new technologies such as Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas.</li>
                <li>9. I learned how to understand data. For example, if I have a very big data set I had to analyse the data set and figure out what data I needed to used
                    for my linear regression model.
