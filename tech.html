    <h1>Technologies that I have used or I will be using in the future</h1>


    <p>Below are some programming languages and a few technologies that are used for <strong>Machine Learning and Data Science</strong>.</p>


    <p><strong>Python:</strong> Python is one of the most popular and best programming languages for making machine learning application, this is because 
    when you write a python program you can run it in parallel, this means that you can make your machine learning algorithms 
    execute and learn very fast because they are running in parallel (a.k.a simultaneously). <br><br>

    <strong>R:</strong> R is a programming language that is mainly used for statistical computing and data visualisation. <br><br>

    <strong>Tensorflow:</strong> Tensorflow is a python library for creating machine learning models and you can run in 
    any environment. <br><br>

    <strong>Anaconda:</strong> Anaconda is a python programming language distribution for scientific computing tasks such as:
    data science, machine learning applications, large scale data processing, predictive analysis. <br><br> 

    <strong>Jupyter notebooks:</strong> A jupyter notebook is a collection of cells that can contain small bits of python code. 
    This can be very good for learning new things such as Machine Learning and Data Science. 
    Instead of having one big python program with lots of stuff that you don't understand, you can have a jupyter notebook 
    with lots of small bits of code individually, then once you are comfortable you can combine them into one big python 
    file if you wish. <br><br>

    <strong>Google Co.Labs:</strong> Google co labs is a service that provides jupyter notebooks, 
    they also provide you with computer hardware such as, graphic processor unit (GPUs) and Tensor processing unit (TPU) 
    This is a good service if you don't have a GPU in your laptop. <br><br>

    <strong>Database:</strong> In order for us to be able to use a Machine Learning Model, we need to be able to store 
    the machine learning model and one of the best ways to do this is a database, 
    the database that I think we might use is a SQL database.</p>

    <h2>Below are some of the topics that are quite important for Data Science and Machine Learning:</h2>

    
    <ol>
        <li>Infrastructure for data</li>
        <li>Data and data storage technologies</li>
        <li>Programming and relevant technical expertise</li>
        <li>Machine learning model's</li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Project's I have built</a></li>
    </ol>



    <h2>Infrastructure for data</h2>
    <p>information will go here</p>

    <h2>Data and data storage technologies</h2>
    <p>In order to be able to store data, we need to use something called a database. A database is a collection of row's and column's and within each 
        row and column there is a piece of data for each section. There is a few diffrent types of database storage technologies such as:
        <ol>
            <li>MYSQL</li>
            <li>NOSQL</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        </ol>
    </p>


    <h2>Programming and relevant technical expertise</h2>
    <p>In the world of Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning(ML), there is a lot of work to be done with the business,
        certain project's and many other factor's come in to play. But one of the biggest parts is doing all of the programming
        and everything that is related to technology. When you are programming AI and ML you will normally use the following
        technologies: TensorFlow, Anaconda, Python and possibily more technologies. 
    </p>


    <h2>Machine learning model's</h2>
    <p>When you are exploring diffrent types of Machine Learning model's, lot's of model's show up. Below are the types of Machine Learning Model's
        that I have heard of: <br>

        <ol>
            <li> K-nearest neighbour</li>
            <li>Decision tree's</li>
            <li>Neural Network's</li>
            <li>Large language model's (LLM's)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
