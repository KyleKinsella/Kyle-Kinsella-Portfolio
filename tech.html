    <h1>Technologies that I have used, or I will be using</h1>

    <h2>Below are some of the topics that are quite important for Data Science and Machine Learning:</h2>

    
    <ol>
        <li>Infrastructure for data</li>
        <li>Data and data storage technologies</li>
        <li>Programming and relevant technical expertise</li>
        <li>Machine learning model's</li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Project's I have built</a></li>

    <h2>Programming and relevant technical expertise</h2>
    <p>In the world of Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning(ML), there is a lot of work to be done with the business,
        certain project's and many other factor's come in to play. But one of the biggest parts is doing all of the programming
        and everything that is related to technology. When you are programming AI and ML you will normally use the following
        technologies: TensorFlow, Anaconda, Python and possibily more technologies. 
    </p>


    <h2>Machine learning model's</h2>
    <p>When you are exploring diffrent types of Machine Learning model's, lot's of model's show up. Below are the types of Machine Learning Model's
        that I have heard of: <br>

        <ol>
            <li> K-nearest neighbour</li>
            <li>Decision tree's</li>
            <li>Neural Network's</li>
            <li>Large language model's (LLM's)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
