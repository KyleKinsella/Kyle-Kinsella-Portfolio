             <!--i might add in google scholar -->
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my random forest project, I used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data, this is the same dataset that
                I used for my decision tree project.</li> <br>
                            
                <li>I did not do any pre processing in this project.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I know what columns I need to use to make my random forest model 
                and what columns I did not need to use, I have two images of my the development of my random forest project and my complete 
                random forest after fixing the issue with help from <strong>chatgpt</strong> to help me fix my problem.</li> <br>

                <li>I did use <a href="https://data36.com/random-forest-in-python/">data36</a> 
                | <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> 
                for doing some research and help when making my random forest.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn.tree, sklearn.model_selection and 
                RandomForestClassifier.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>Due to a random forest being multiple diffrent decision trees, I decided to use the same dataset that I used for my linear regression and decision trees. 
            I am also using some of the same code in my random forest from decision trees but I am putting this data into a random forest model instead.
            The dataset I am using is from kaggle because I could not find any other good sources and I am also quite familiar with this dataset now because I have made three
            projects with this dataset.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>During this project on random forest I did not do any pre-processing because my dataset is very small.</p>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            
            <p>Yet again I had a very big problem with trying to visualize my data onto my random forest model. This time I was not having my random forest show the 
            model with blurry nodes, but instead I my python code was always giving me an error and this was stopping me from visualizing my random forest.
            Below are some figures that illustrate what problems I encountered: </p> <br><br>
            
                
            <strong>Figure 1</strong> is the error I was continuously getting from python.<br>
            <strong>Figure 2</strong> is the working random forest after I fixed this error I was getting (this random forest has a max-depth of 3).<br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my random forest project I found a few sources online that were a lot of help to me.</p>

            <strong>data36: </strong> <a href="https://data36.com/random-forest-in-python/">data36</a><br>
            <strong>ChatGpt: </strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>

            <p>The above websites were very helpful for this project. I used data36 to do some background research on random forest's
            and it also gives you some basic code to get up and started with a random forest in python. Before I asked chatgpt anything
            I had did out my own code and I was happy but it was not working perfectly, so I aksed chatgpt a question something along 
            the lines of "how do I get my dataframe called "X" and y into my random forest model?" and he re-wrote out my code but he
            added a new line of code, before I took this code I took some time to understand the code then I put it into my random forest
            model and then I got the error to go away and my random forest model was working.</p> <br>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my random forest model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib as plt</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.tree plot_tree</strong> <br>  
            <strong>sklearn.model_selection train_test_split</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.ensemble RandomForestClassifier</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as RandomForestClassifier and all of the others I have previously
            used for my linear regression and decision tree projects.
            
            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called RandomForestClassifier. This is a library is used for making a 
            random forest and training, your random forest model.<br><br>

            During this project I used a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
