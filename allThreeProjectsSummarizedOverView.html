            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <!--<p>Linear regression ..., dt ..., rf ...</p>  I was going to do it like this but this is not a good idea--> 
        
            <h4>For all of my data sources for all three projects I used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data.</h4> <br>

                <!-- Linear Regression part -->
                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>
                <p>During my linear regression project I found a dataset for sports. I was trying not to use kaggle data
                due to it being cleaned and pre-processed but I was unable to find any other good sports datasets elsewhere.</p> <br><br>

                <!-- Decision Tree part -->
                <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
                <p> I used the same dataset from my linear regression project, because it was easy to understand and use.</p> <br><br>

                <!-- Random Forest part -->
                <h4>Random Forest</h4>
                <p>I used the dataset that I used for my linear regression project and decision tree projects.</p> <br><br>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            
            <p>Yet again I had a very big problem with trying to visualize my data onto my random forest model. This time I was not having my random forest show the 
            model with blurry nodes, but instead I my python code was always giving me an error and this was stopping me from visualizing my random forest.
            Below are some figures that illustrate what problems I encountered: </p> <br><br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my random forest project I found a few sources online that were a lot of help to me.</p>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my random forest model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib as plt</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.tree plot_tree</strong> <br>  
            <strong>sklearn.model_selection train_test_split</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.ensemble RandomForestClassifier</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as RandomForestClassifier and all of the others I have previously
            used for my linear regression and decision tree projects.
            
            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called RandomForestClassifier. This is a library is used for making a 
            random forest and training, your random forest model.<br><br>

            During this project I used a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
