            <!--<p>Linear regression ..., dt ..., rf ...</p>  I was going to do it like this but this is not a good idea--> 
        
            <h4>For all of my data sources for all three projects I used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data.</h4> <br>

            <ul>
                <!-- Linear Regression part -->
                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>
                <li>During my linear regression project I found a dataset for sports. I was trying not to use kaggle data
                due to it being cleaned and pre-processed but I was unable to find any other good sports datasets elsewhere.</li> <br>

                <!-- Decision Tree part -->
                <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
                <li>I used the same dataset from my linear regression project, because it was easy to understand and use.</li> <br>

                <!-- Random Forest part -->
                <h4>Random Forest</h4>
                <li>I used the dataset that I used for my linear regression project and decision tree projects.</li> <br>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>     
                <li>During my linear regression project I did some pre-processing. I got my dataset
                and I split it into half to try and make the data easier to visualize but in the end I was not able to 
                visualize it even do I split the data to be very small.</li> <br>

                <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
                <li>During my decision tree project I did not do any pre-processing this is due to my 
                dataset being very small.</li> <br>
                
                <h4>Random Forest</h4>
                <li>Since I did not do any pre-processing for my decision tree project, I did not do any pre-processing my random forest project 
                because a random forest is made up of many decision trees.</li> <br>

            <ul>
                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>     
                <li>During my linear regression project I encountered a few issues when making my model. Due to my dataset being very 
                small my data did not plot to well on my graph. <strong>See figure 1</strong>.</li> <br>
                
                <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
                <li>During my decision tree project I encountered one very big problem when making my model. When I had made my decision tree model in my 
                python code I then was trying to visualize my model but I was having a lot of trouble when trying to achieve this. I used chatgpt 
                to help me with this problem. <strong>See figure 2</strong>.</li> <br>
   
                <h4>Random Forest</h4>
                <li>During my random forest project I did not encounter too much problems, this is due to 
                me learning how to fix certain things from my two other projects and also I understand my dataset very well. <strong>See figure 3</strong>.</li> <br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest 
            projects I found a few sources online that were a lot of help to me.</p>

            <h4>Linear Regression</h4>
            <p>During my linear regression project I used: Wiley see reference [1] and I also used Jake Vanderplas Python Book see reference [2]. 


            <h4><strong>Why did I use these?</strong></h4>
            I used wiley to do a bit of reading on linear regression before doing any coding and I also used Jake Vanderplas Python Book to get an 
            idea on how to code out a linear regression model in python. <br>
            <strong>Wiley</strong><a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1380"> Wiley reference [1]</a>. <br>
            <strong>Jake Vanderplas Python Book</strong><a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.06-Linear-Regression.ipynb"> Jake Vanderplas Python Book reference [2]</a>. <br><br>


            <h4>Decision Tree</h4>
            <p>During my decision tree project I used: W3Schools see reference [1], I used Mljar see reference [2] and I also used ChatGPT see reference [3].
            
            <h4><strong>Why did I use these?</strong></h4>
            I used w3schools to do some basic coding with a decision tree in python, I used mljar to help me visualize my decision tree and I used chatgpt to help me 
            to visualize to decision tree due to most of the websites being helpful but they did not work. <br>
            <strong>W3Schools</strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_decision_tree.asp"> W3Schools reference [1]</a>. <br>
            <strong>Mljar</strong><a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/"> Mljar reference [2]</a>. <br>
            <strong>ChatGPT</strong><a href="https://chatgpt.com/"> ChatGPT reference [3]</a>. <br><br>


            <h4>Random Forest</h4>
            <p>During my random forest project I used: data36 see reference [1] and I also used chatgpt see reference [2]. 
            
            <h4><strong>Why did I use these?</strong></h4>
            I used data36 to do some research on what a random forest is and how to program one, I also used chatgpt to help me visualize my random forest. <br>
            <strong>data36</strong><a href="https://data36.com/random-forest-in-python/"> data36 reference [1].</a><br>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my random forest model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib as plt</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.tree plot_tree</strong> <br>  
            <strong>sklearn.model_selection train_test_split</strong> <br>
            <strong>sklearn.ensemble RandomForestClassifier</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as RandomForestClassifier and all of the others I have previously
            used for my linear regression and decision tree projects.
            
            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called RandomForestClassifier. This is a library is used for making a 
            random forest and training, your random forest model.<br><br>

            During this project I used a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
