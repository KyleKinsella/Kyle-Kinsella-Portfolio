            Data Science and Machine Learning 1</h2>

                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>
                <li>How to understand and analyse my dataset</li> 
                <li>I learned what Linear Regression is and what it is used for</li> 
                <li>I learned how to do some pre-processing, the pre-processing I did was I split one of my big datasets into half.</li> 

                <h4>Decision Trees & Random Forest</h4>
                <li>I learned how to visualize a decision tree and random forest</li> 
                <li>If you don't give your decision tree or random forest a max-depth it will look very bad, so make sure you give it a max-depth</li>
