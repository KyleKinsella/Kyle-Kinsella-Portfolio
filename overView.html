            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my linear regression project, I did use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data, I tried my best to not use Kaggle data but I was unable to find 
                    any other good sports data elsewhere.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did some pre processing such as, splitting my data set up to be a good bit smaller but in the end I had to stop working with that data set.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I am able to identify what columns I need to use for my linear regression model and what columns I didnt need 
                    to use, I also have three images of my linear regression model throughtout the building process of this project each of the graphs have a 
                    different data set to them.</li><br>

                <li>I did use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> for my project. I searched for "linear regression machine learning for sports" 
                    to see if there was any help or algorithms that might be helpful for me during this project.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           <p>Before I started to work with linear regression I needed to find some sports data to use for my linear regression model. I tried to find sports data on different sites to kaggle
            but I was unable to find any data on other sites, so I had to use kaggle data.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>When I was working with a bigger
                data set I encountered a really big problem and that problem was that the data set was too big, so I did some <strong>pre processing</strong> such as 
                splitting that data set into half, but the data set was still to big, and I kept splitting the data up, but no matter what I did 
                the data on my graph would not look any better. So after a few hours of coding I decided to stop working on that data set due to the 
                issues that I was encountering.

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During this project for linear regression I encountered many issues when working on this project such as, my linear regression
                model didn't fit my data because my data set was very small. Due to my data set being very small I analysed my graph and I 
                concluded that I needed to find a bigger data set, to make my linear regression model more accurate. Below are three images that show my 
                linear regression model throughout the duration of this project. After I could not get the previous data set to work, 
                I found a bigger data set on kaggle but not too big as I want to show my work on a graph. <br><br>
                
                <strong>Figure 1</strong> is the graph with the very small data set (Goals conceded vs Goals Scored). <br>
                <strong>Figure 2</strong> is the graph with the the really big data set (No names on the graph).<br>
                <strong>Figure 3</strong> is the graph with the data set that I found to be the best (Games Won vs Games Played).<br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
           <p>During the development of my linear regression project I did some research on different types of algorithms used for linear 
            regression. I read some articles on Google Scholar about linear regression and how linear regression works. I found this article 
            to be quite useful and helpful during this project <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/widm.1380">Linear 
            Regression for sports predictions</a>.</p>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my linear regression model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.linear_model</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas.
                Before I had never worked with Matplotlib in python, so during this project I developed the basics on how to use Matplotlib. I use
                Matplotlib for plotting my data onto my graph using plt.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Sklearn.linear_model. This is a library for fitting a line to your data, to see 
            if your data is linear or not. In order to be able to use the line in your code you must set the fit_intercept to be true, otherwise there will be no
            line to draw. <br><br>

            One more technology I used in this project was a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
