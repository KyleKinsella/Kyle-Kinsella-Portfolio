                <p>To be completely honest I did not learn to much with this random forest project,
                this is due to the fact that a random forest is made up of multiple different 
                decision tree's.</p> <br><br>

                <p>In my previous project for decision tree's I did learn a lot because I had never made a decision tree before, but due to me understand how to
                make a decision tree it was quite easy to make a random forest. The code even behind a random forest is very similar to a decision tree.</p>
