             <!--i might add in google scholar -->
            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my decision tree project, I did use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data, I tried to find other sports 
                datasets elsewhere but I could not find any.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did do pre processing in this project, I made my small dataset to be a bit bigger.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I am able to identify what columns I need to use to make my decision tree model 
                and what columns I did not need to use, I also have three images of my different views of my decision tree throughout the 
                development of this project.</li><br>

                <li>I did use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_decision_tree.asp">W3Schools</a> 
                | <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/">Mljar</a> | <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> 
                for help when making my decision tree.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas, Sklearn tree, 
                Sklearn plot_tree, Sklearn.tree DecisionTreeClassifier and Sklearn.datasets load_iris.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           <p>Before I started to work on my decision tree project, I retrieved my dataset that I used for 
           my linear regression project because I wanted to use that dataset for my decision tree project. The dataset I am using is from kaggle 
           but I was trying to find other sports datasets elsewhere but I was unable to find any other useful websites for this, because of 
           this I reused my previous dataset that I had for my linear regression project.</p>

            <p>During this project on decision trees I did do pre-processing, I made my small dataset from 25 rows to be of 150 or so rows.</p>

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During this project for decision trees I encountered a few issues such as, One of the biggest
            issues I encountered was not being able to visualize my decision tree. My decision tree was displaying in my jupyter
            notebook cell but you were unable to actual read the contents of each branch on the tree. Below are some figures that illustrate 
            what problems I encountered: <br><br>
            
                
            <strong>Figure 1</strong> is the decision tree with the colours (this is with no max-depth).<br>
            <strong>Figure 2</strong> is the decision tree with the really blurry big decision tree floating down the right of the screen
            (this is also with no max-depth).<br>
            <strong>Figure 3</strong> is the decision tree you can actually read the tree unlike the above decision trees 
            (this decision tree does have a max-depth of 3).<br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my decision tree project I found a few sources online that were some help to me.</p>

            <strong>W3Schools: </strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_decision_tree.asp">W3Schools</a><br>
            <strong>Mljar: </strong> <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/">Mljar</a><br>
            <strong>ChatGpt: </strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a><br>

            <p>All of the above websites were very helpful for this project. I used w3schools to get an understanding on how to code out a decision
            tree in python. I used mljar to try and help me visualize my decision tree and finally, I did use chatgpt, I asked him how do 
            I get my decision tree to show without it being blurry and he did help me out with this problem I had.</p> <br>

            <p>The reason why my decision tree was so large and blurry was due to me not having a max-depth on my decision tree once I added 
            the max-depth into my decision tree code my decision tree was not blurry and you are now able to read it.</p>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my decision tree model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.linear_model</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn tree</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn plot_tree</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.tree DecisionTreeClassifier</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.datasets load_iris</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas,
            Sklearn datasets and much more.
                Before I had never worked with Sklearn datasets in python, so during this project I developed the basics on how to visualize
                my decision tree using load_iris.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Sklearn.tree. This is a library for making a decision tree and training, 
            your decision tree model.<br><br>

            During this project I used a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
