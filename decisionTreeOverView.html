            <ol>
                <li>To summarize my linear regression project, I did use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> data, I tried my best to not use Kaggle data but I was unable to find 
                    any other good sports data elsewhere.</li><br> 
            
                <li>I did some pre processing such as, splitting my data set up to be a good bit smaller but in the end I had to stop working with that data set.</li><br>
            
                <li>I do understand the data that I have, I am able to identify what columns I need to use for my linear regression model and what columns I didnt need 
                    to use, I also have three images of my linear regression model throughtout the building process of this project each of the graphs have a 
                    different data set to them.</li><br>

                <li>I did use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> for my project. I searched for "linear regression machine learning for sports" 
                    to see if there was any help or algorithms that might be helpful for me during this project.</li><br>
            
                <li>During this project I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas.</li>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
           <p>Before I started to work on my decision tree project, I retrieved my dataset that I used for 
           my linear regression project because I wanted to use that dataset for my decision tree project. Just to remind you this dataset is from kaggle 
           but I was trying to find other sports datasets elsewhere but I was unable to find any other useful websites for this, because of this I reused my previous dataset
           that I had for my linear regression project.</p>

            <h2>Pre Processing</h2>
            <p>When I was working with a bigger
                data set I encountered a really big problem and that problem was that the data set was too big, so I did some <strong>pre processing</strong> such as 
                splitting that data set into half, but the data set was still to big, and I kept splitting the data up, but no matter what I did 
                the data on my graph would not look any better. So after a few hours of coding I decided to stop working on that data set due to the 
                issues that I was encountering.

            <h2>Data Understanding & Visualization</h2>
            <p>During this project for decision trees I encountered many issues when working on this project such as, One of the biggest
            issues I encountered was not being able to visualize my decision tree. My decision tree was displaying in my jupyter
            notebook cell but you were unable to actual read the contents of each branch on the tree. Below are some figures that illustrate 
            what problems I encountered: <br><br>
            
                
            <strong>Figure 1</strong> is the decision tree with the colours (this is with no max-depth).<br>
            <strong>Figure 2</strong> is the decision tree with the really blurry big decision tree floating down the right of the screen
            (this is also with no max-depth).<br>
            <strong>Figure 3</strong> is the decision tree you can actually read the tree unlike the above decision trees 
            (this decision tree does have a max-depth of 3)<br>

            <h2>Algorithms Online & Sources</h2>
            <p>During the development of my decision tree project I found a few sources online that were some help to me.</p>

            <strong><li>W3Schools:</strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_decision_tree.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
            <strong><li>Mljar:</strong> <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/">Mljar</a></li>
            <strong><li>ChatGPT:</strong> <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a></li>            

            <p>All of the above websites were very helpful for this project. I used w3schools to get an understanding on how to code out a decision
            tree in python. I used mljar to try and help me visualize my decision tree. And finally, I did use chatgpt, I asked him how do 
            I get my decision tree to show without it being blurry and he did help me out with this problem I had.</p> <br>

            <p>The reason why my decision tree was so large and blurry was due to me not having a max-depth on my decision tree once I added 
            the max-depth into my decision tree code my decision tree was not blurry and you are now able to read it.</p>

            <h2>Tool's & Technology Used</h2>
            <p>When I was developing my decision tree model I used the following technologies:</p>
          
            <strong>Python</strong> <br>
            <strong>Jupyter Notebook's</strong>  <br>
            <strong>Matplotlib</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.linear_model</strong> <br>
            <strong>Pandas</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn tree</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn plot_tree</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.tree DecisionTreeClassifier</strong> <br>
            <strong>Sklearn.datasets load_iris</strong> <br><br>

            <p>During this project I got familiar with some of the python libraries such as Matplotlib, Sklearn.linear_model and Pandas,
            Sklearn datasets and much more.
                Before I had never worked with Sklearn datasets in python, so during this project I developed the basics on how to visualize
                my decision tree using load_iris.<br><br>

            Another technology that I had never used before in python is called Sklearn.tree. This is a library for making a decision tree and training, 
            your decision tree model.<br><br>

            During this project I used a library called pandas. This library is a very useful tool, particularly when working with csv files in excel.
        	The main function I used in pandas was called, pd.read_csv(...). This line of code will read a csv file for you, you need to pass in a filename that you want
        	to read.<br><br>

        	Before I had started to code anything for this project, I already had a good understanding on how the python programming language and how it operates and
        	I also had a good idea on how to use Jupyter Notebooks. These technologies are a must when working with data science and machine learning.
